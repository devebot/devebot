> Nodejs Microservice Framework

## Introduction

Devebot is tiny microservice framework for Nodejs. It is designed under some important principles:

* High modularity
* Reusable
* Easy to integrate

![Architecture](https://raw.github.com/devebot/codetags/master/docs/assets/images/devebot-architecture.png)


Based on the devebot framework, the application is decomposed into `plugins`, each of which implements a particular feature. The framework provides `bridges` which wraps or connects to other services like REST API or database servers.
